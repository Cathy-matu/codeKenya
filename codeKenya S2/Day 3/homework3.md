# 🎉 Thank You All for Attending the 3rd Recruiting Prep Session

## 📚 Your Homework for This Week  
**🗓 Deadline: Tuesday, July 9th at 11:59 PM EAT**

---

### ✅ 1. Set Up GitHub
- If you haven't yet: **create or log into your GitHub account**.
- Fork and clone the [CodeKenya Repository](https://github.com/muregii/codeKenya).
- Don’t forget to ⭐ **star the repo**!

---

### ✅ 2. Create a New Branch
- Name the branch after **your full name**, e.g., `john-doe`.

---

### ✅ 3. Solve the Python Question: **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock**

> You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i-th` day.  
> You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day to buy** one stock and choosing a **different day in the future to sell** that stock.  
> Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If no profit is possible, return `0`.

#### 🧪 Examples:

```python
Input: prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5
# Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6 - 1 = 5
```

```python
Input: prices = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0
# No profit can be made as prices are decreasing
```

#### 📌 Constraints:
- `1 <= prices.length <= 10⁵`  
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10⁴`

🔗 Solve it on LeetCode: [**Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock – LeetCode**](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

---

### ✅ 4. Add Your Solution
- Create a new `.py` file, e.g., `best_time_to_buy_stock.py`.
- 📂 **Folder Structure:**  
  Inside the repo, go to:  
  `codeKenya S2/Day 3/` → create a folder with **your name**, e.g., `john-doe/`  
  → Place your `.py` solution file there.

---

### ✅ 5. Commit Your Work

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Solved Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock"
```

---

### ✅ 6. Push & Open a Pull Request

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Then, go to GitHub and open a **Pull Request**.

#### 💬 PR Description Should Include:
- 🔍 A short summary of your approach  
- 🧠 One new thing you learned  
- ❓ Any challenge you faced during Git/GitHub or solving the question

---

### ⚠️ Reminder:
Before pushing, always pull the latest changes from `main`:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

> This helps avoid conflicts and ensures your folder structure matches the updated repo.
