"""
        To reverse a singly linked list in-place, we iterate through the list while changing the 
        direction of each nodeâ€™s next pointer. We keep track of:
        - prev: the previous node (initially None)
        - curr: the current node (initially head)
        - next_node: stores the next node before we change curr.next
        
        This results in a reversed list with O(n) time and O(1) space complexity.
