# Thank You All for Attending Today's Session 🎉

## 📚 Your Homework for This Week  
**🗓 Deadline: Tuesday, July 8th at 11:59 PM EAT**

---

### 1. ✅ Set Up GitHub
- If you haven't yet: **create or log into your GitHub account**.
- Fork and clone the [CodeKenya Repository](https://github.com/CodeKenya).
- Don’t forget to ⭐ **star the repo**!

---

### 2. ✅ Create a New Branch
- Name the branch after **your full name** (e.g., `john-doe`).

---

### 3. ✅ Solve the Python Question: **Contains Duplicate**

> Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears **at least twice** in the array, and return `false` if every element is **distinct**.

**Examples:**

```python
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: True
# The element 1 occurs at indices 0 and 3.

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: False
# All elements are distinct.

Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: True
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10⁵`
- `-10⁹ <= nums[i] <= 10⁹`

🔗 Solve it on LeetCode: [Contains Duplicate – LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)

---

### 4. ✅ Add Your Solution
- Create a **new `.py` file** in your branch (e.g., `contains_duplicate_john.py`).
- Write your Python solution in that file.
- 📂 Place Your Code File Here:  
- Inside the repository, navigate to:  
- `codeKenya S2/Day 2/` and create a **folder with your name** (e.g., `john-doe`).  
- Inside that folder, add your Python solution file (e.g., `contains_duplicate.py`).


---

### 5. ✅ Commit Your Work
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Solved Contains Duplicate problem"
```

---

### 6. ✅ Push & Open a Pull Request
```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Then, open a **Pull Request** on GitHub.

Include in the **PR description**:
- 🔍 A brief summary of your approach  
- 🧠 Something new you learned  
- ❓ Any parts where you got stuck during your interaction with Git & GitHub or solving the code  

---

Happy Coding! 🚀
