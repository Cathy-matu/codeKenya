Dynamic programming ni ... maswali zinaezasolviwa na recursion. or can be solved
by dividing a problem into subproblems. 

Dynamic programming(Bottom up approach. ) - finding how to solve a list with one element, then two elements, then three e.t.c

- ni basically kuchukua a recursive algorithm , finding subproblem ina overlap alafu
caching the results for future recursive calls.
They sounds like, 
*   Find the nth ...,
*   List the first n ...,
*   Compute all ...,



Example of a question on Leetcode ni:
Popular ones:
*   Fibonacci numbers - finding the nth Fibonacci number. Ukisolve recursively runtime ni O(2^n) "exponential" / Very poor *refer to pg112
Solving it in a top down/ recursive memoized approach (Dynamic programming) / also called memoization itafanya na runtime ya O(n)
