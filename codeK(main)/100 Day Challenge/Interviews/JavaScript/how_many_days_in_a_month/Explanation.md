## Challenge

Write a function that takes in a month and returns the number of days in that month.

## Approach

1. We have a function `how_many_days` that takes in a month as an argument.
2. We use a switch statement to check the month and return the number of days in that month.
3. If the month is not valid, we return "Invalid".

## Example

```js
const result = how_many_days(2);
console.log(result); // 28
```

## Explanation

```
    The month is 2, which is February. February has 28 days.
```
