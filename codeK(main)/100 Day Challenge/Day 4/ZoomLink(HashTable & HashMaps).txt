Around TimeStamp[10:00] nilidanganya ati the linked lists zinahold both Key na Value. Zii, Izo 00 01 ndio Keys, alafu nodes ziko kwa LinkedLists zinahold tu the value portion.

There's a mistake while I was explaining the twosum question.

My explanation was a bit wrong, evem though it passed the testcases. I'll create a make up video.

I said that .get() retrieves the Key. I should be .get() takes a Key as its input and
 returns the value of that key.

 So in the comments. When we passed 2 as our Key from nums[i] in the .put() and 0 as the Value bacause of i, which was at 0
 indexToNumber.get(target - nums[i], i) should return [0, 1] --> O from the value associated with the Key 2 that was on our map, and 1 from i, which is because i = 1 in our second iteration.
  Our first iteration did not return an int[] because our HashMap was yet to be populated !

      Thank you.
