Okay, let's use the Feynman Learning Technique to explain the "Maximum Area of Rectangle" problem and solution:

# Leetcode - Maximum Area of Rectangle

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `height` representing the heights of `n` vertical lines, where the width of each line is 1, find the maximum area of the rectangle formed by the lines.

## Solution

The solution to this problem is implemented in the code snippet. Here's how it works:


The goal is to find the maximum area of a rectangle that can be formed using the vertical lines represented by the `height` array.

We start by looking at the line on the left and the line on the right. The height of the rectangle will be the height of the shorter of the two lines, and the width will be the distance between the two lines. We calculate the area of this rectangle and keep track of the largest area we've found so far.

Then, we move the left line to the right if the left line is shorter, or move the right line to the left if the right line is shorter. We keep doing this, moving the shorter line closer to the center, until the left line and the right line meet in the middle.

The key steps are:
1. Initialize `left` to the first index and `right` to the last index of the `height` array.
2. In each iteration:
   - Calculate the minimum height between the lines at `left` and `right`.
   - Calculate the width by subtracting `left` from `right`.
   - Calculate the area by multiplying the width and minimum height.
   - Update the maximum area found so far.
   - Move the shorter line (left or right) towards the center.
3. Return the maximum area found.

Does this make sense? Great!

## Usage

To use the solution, you can call the `maxArea` method with an integer array representing the heights of the vertical lines:

```java
int[] height = {1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7};
Solution solution = new Solution();
int maxArea = solution.maxArea(height);
System.out.println(maxArea); // Output: 49
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array `height`. This is because we are iterating through the array once, with the left and right pointers converging towards the middle.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are only using a constant amount of extra space to store the `left`, `right`, and `area` variables.
