# Leetcode - Nth Ugly Number

## Problem Description

An **ugly number** is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to `2`, `3`, and `5`.

Given an integer `n`, return the `nth` **ugly number**.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 1690`

## Solution

**Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the *n*th **ugly number**, where an ugly number has only the prime factors 2, 3, and 5.
   - The sequence of ugly numbers starts with 1 (the smallest ugly number) and can be generated by repeatedly multiplying previous ugly numbers by 2, 3, or 5.
   - Our task is to compute the *n*th number in this sequence.

**Breaking It Down**
   - **Ugly Number Generation:**
     - The first ugly number is `1`.
     - To generate subsequent ugly numbers, we maintain three lists or indices: 
       - One to track multiples of 2.
       - One to track multiples of 3.
       - One to track multiples of 5.
     - For each step, the next ugly number is the minimum among the current candidates from each of the three lists. After choosing an ugly number, we increment the corresponding index (i.e., the one responsible for generating that ugly number).

**Implementation Approach:**
   - Use dynamic programming to generate ugly numbers in sequence.
   - Maintain three pointers (indices) for multiples of 2, 3, and 5, and repeatedly choose the smallest number from the current candidates.
   - After selecting the smallest number, increment the corresponding pointer(s) and repeat the process until we generate the *n*th ugly number.

**Algorithm Steps:**
   - **Initialize Pointers:** Start with three pointers at index 0, representing the multiples of 2, 3, and 5.
   - **Generate Ugly Numbers:** For each iteration, compute the next ugly number by taking the minimum of the current multiples of 2, 3, and 5.
   - **Update Pointers:** After selecting the next ugly number, increment the pointer corresponding to the factor that produced this number.
   - **Repeat:** Continue generating numbers until we reach the *n*th ugly number.

### Python Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        
```

### Example

```python
# Input
n = 10

# Output
12
```

### Explanation:
1. **Ugly numbers sequence:** The first 10 ugly numbers are `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12]`.
2. The 10th ugly number is `12`.

### Usage

To use the solution, create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `nthUglyNumber` method with the `n` value:

```python
# Example usage
solution = Solution()
n = 10
result = solution.nthUglyNumber(n)
print(result)  # Output: 12
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), as we compute the first *n* ugly numbers in sequence.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), since we store the list of the first *n* ugly numbers.
