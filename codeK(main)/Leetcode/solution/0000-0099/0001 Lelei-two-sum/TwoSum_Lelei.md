The `TwoSum` class provides a method to find indices of two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target. Here's how it works:

1. **Main Method:**
   - Initializes an array of integers and a target sum.
   - Calls the `twoSum` method to find the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target sum.
   - Prints the result.

2. **`twoSum` Method:**
   - Takes an array of integers and a target sum as arguments.
   - Uses a `HashMap` to track the complement of each number (the difference between the target and the current number).
   - Iterates over the array, checking if each number's complement is already in the map (which would indicate that we've found a pair of numbers that add up to the target).
   - If such a pair is found, returns their indices.
   - If no pair is found, incorrectly returns the original array (this should be corrected to return an indication that no solution exists).

Here's the code:

```java
class TwoSum {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        
        int[] val = {22,0,11,9};
        int tgt = 9;
        int[] result = twoSum(val, tgt);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result));
    } 

    public static int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> complements = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            Integer complementIndex = complements.get(nums[i]);
            if (complementIndex != null) {
                return new int[]{i, complementIndex};
            }
            complements.put(target - nums[i], i);
        }
        return nums;  // This should be corrected to return `null` or an empty array.
    }
}
