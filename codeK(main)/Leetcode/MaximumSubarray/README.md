# Title: Maximum Subarray Problem

## Description:

The Maximum Subarray Problem is a classic algorithmic problem that aims to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest sum. This problem is widely used in various applications, including finance, data analysis, and machine learning.

## Algorithm:

We can solve the Maximum Subarray Problem using a dynamic programming approach known as Kadane's Algorithm. The algorithm maintains two variables: max_current and max_global. At each iteration, it updates max_current to be the maximum of the current element and the sum of the current element and the previous max_current. It also updates max_global to be the maximum of max_current and max_global.
